# Next.js Project

This is one of my smaller projects built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). It demonstrates my skills and experience as a full-stack developer, particularly with:
- **Next.js** for server-side rendering and dynamic routing.
- **MySQL** with **Prisma** as the ORM for efficient database interactions.
- **TypeScript** on the client side for type safety and maintainability.

## Deployment
The project is deployed and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), ensuring fast load times and a reliable experience. You can check out the live version of this project **[on this link](https://your-vercel-link.com)**

## About
While this project showcases my proficiency with Next.js, TypeScript, and MySQL, it is one of my smaller-scale efforts. I have a much larger project that demonstrates more complex functionality and my full range of skills as a full-stack developer.

### Getting Started
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/peled12/job-listing
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```bash
   cd job-listing
3. install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
4. start the deployment server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

## My Larger Project:
My other project is a much more comprehensive application where I:
- Used Create React App (CRA) for the frontend, written in JavaScript.
- Built the backend with Node.js and MongoDB.
- Designed and implemented complex features to handle data-rich interactions and user experiences.
